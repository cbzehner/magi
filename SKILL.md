# Magi

Query Gemini, Codex, and Claude as advisors. Synthesize their input. You write all code.

## How to Query Advisors

**Run all 3 in parallel** (single message):

```
# Gemini (via Bash)
Bash: scripts/ask_gemini.sh "[ADVISOR_PROMPT]"
      run_in_background: true

# Codex (via Bash)
Bash: scripts/ask_codex.sh "[ADVISOR_PROMPT]"
      run_in_background: true

# Claude (via Task subagent - no CLI needed!)
Task:
  subagent_type: "general-purpose"
  model: "opus"
  prompt: "You are a senior software architect advisor. [ADVISOR_PROMPT]
           Provide: 1) Approach 2) Steps 3) Risks 4) Alternatives"
  run_in_background: true

# Then collect results
TaskOutput: [gemini_task_id]
TaskOutput: [codex_task_id]
TaskOutput: [claude_task_id]
```

**Why this approach?** Claude uses a Task subagent (which IS Claude) - no subprocess needed. Gemini/Codex use their CLIs via Bash. Running `claude -p` as a subprocess would hang due to session contention.

## Tool Selection

| Task | Best Advisor | Why |
|------|--------------|-----|
| Web/API docs | Gemini | google_web_search |
| Current info | Gemini | Web access |
| Fast analysis | Codex | Speed |
| Large context | Gemini | 1M tokens |
| Deep reasoning | Claude | Opus model |
| Code review | Claude | Code expertise |
| Architecture | Claude | Reasoning depth |

## Planning Workflow

```
Planning Progress:
- [ ] Query all three advisors with task context
- [ ] Review responses for agreements/conflicts
- [ ] Synthesize into unified plan
- [ ] Present to user with reasoning
- [ ] Implement (you write the code)
```

**Advisor prompt template**:
```
Task: [description]
Context: [codebase context]
Constraints: [limitations]

Provide: 1) Approach 2) Steps 3) Risks 4) Alternatives
```

## Debugging Workflow

```
Debugging Progress:
- [ ] Gather error context
- [ ] Query all three advisors with error + code
- [ ] Evaluate suggested fixes
- [ ] Implement fix yourself
- [ ] Verify solution
```

**Advisor prompt template**:
```
Error: [message]
Code: [relevant code]
Context: [what was attempted]

Provide: 1) Likely cause 2) Investigation steps 3) Fix 4) Prevention
```

## Research Workflow

**Advisor prompt template**:
```
Topic: [question]
Context: [why needed]

Provide: 1) Key findings 2) Sources 3) Applicability 4) Caveats
```

## Synthesis Patterns

When combining advisor responses:

| Pattern | When | Action |
|---------|------|--------|
| **Consensus** | All agree | Proceed with confidence |
| **Complementary** | Different but compatible | Combine insights |
| **Conflict** | Direct contradiction | Evaluate evidence, decide |
| **Gap** | One silent | Query specifically or use own knowledge |

**Synthesis format**:
```
Gemini: [key points]
Codex: [key points]
Claude: [key points]
Synthesis: [recommendation]
Reasoning: [why, noting agreements/conflicts]
```

## Handling Disagreements

When advisors conflict:

1. **Categorize**: Factual (verify docs), Architectural (consider constraints), Stylistic (follow project), Risk (evaluate evidence)
2. **Evaluate evidence**: Good = specific references, reasoned arguments. Weak = vague claims, false confidence.
3. **Apply context**: Existing patterns, team expertise, requirements
4. **Decide**: Prefer simpler, prefer reversible, prefer established
5. **Communicate**: "Gemini suggested X, Codex suggested Y, Claude suggested Z, I chose W because..."

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **False consensus**: Agreement does not equal correctness
- **Authority bias**: Preferring one advisor without reason
- **Analysis paralysis**: Over-deliberating minor decisions
- **Ignoring context**: Generic advice to specific situation
